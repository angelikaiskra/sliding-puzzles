## How to play?
Sliding puzzles are a game where you move pieces around on a board to make a picture or sequence. You slide the pieces into the empty space without lifting them off the board.
To start playing, simply select a puzzle from the catalog or upload your own image. The game starts with the pieces all mixed up, and you have to slide them around until they are in the right order.
Have fun! :D
